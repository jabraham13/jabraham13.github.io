        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived
            alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had
            built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts,
            and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two
            years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life
            again.
        </p>
        <p>
            I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if
            very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning
            my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not
            appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances,
            very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did
            not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been
            curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable
            purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I
            maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no
            particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of
            these questions in this book. In most books, the _I_, or first person,
            is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism,
            is the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after
            all, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so
            much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well.
            Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my
            experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or
            last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what
            he has heard of other menâ€™s lives; some such account as he would send
            to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it
            must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more
            particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers,
            they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will
            stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to
            him whom it fits.
