<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="text-justify">
    I was born in Liverpool, England and I live in Canada. I have lived in enough 
    places that no matter where I am in the world someone will make 
    fun of the way I talk. Rain and snow hold no fear for me but 
    after a few Canadian Winters I have come to appreciate the 
    Summer. I like to live near rivers or large bodies of water 
    although I find the idea of living in a desert intriguing.

    I have had a range of jobs involving everything from stacking 
    shoes to looking out at the furthest reaches of space through a 
    giant telescope while listening to Pink Floyd. I survived a 
    DPhil at Oxford University, Sunday evening in the Imperial 
    College Union Bar and I was taught by nuns so it takes a lot to 
    scare me.

    I approach the Universe with a sense of awe-struck skepticism. 
    There is magic out there but it is not for sale and it will not 
    reward you for doing harm, now matter how convincing the man 
    holding the microphone or the sacred book appears.
